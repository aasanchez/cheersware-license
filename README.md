# Cheersware License

In a world where software powers nearly every aspect of our lives, the licenses
governing its use have become increasingly complex, legalistic, and at times,
intimidating. While it's important to protect intellectual property and ensure
clarity around usage rights, many developers—especially those building for the
open-source community—are less interested in enforcing control and more
interested in spreading utility, creativity, and collaboration.

The Cheersware License was born out of this spirit: a desire to make software
licensing simple, human, and free of legal entanglements—while still providing a
nod to the value that open work brings to others.

At its core, Cheersware is a celebration of human connection. It assumes good
faith. It encourages kindness. And it replaces restrictive clauses and
intimidating legalese with something more familiar: a friendly invitation to
share a drink—be it a coffee, tea, beer, or anything that brings people
together. It says: “Use this freely. And if it helps you, raise a glass next
time we meet.”

## Why Cheersware?

* Simple to understand: No jargon, no subclauses, no "Section 9.4(a)(iii)"
  confusion. Just a clear, readable license you can grasp in a single breath.
* No legal BS: We’ve stripped away the intimidating parts. This license isn't
  here to trap you—it's here to empower you.
* Encourages freedom: You can use the code, modify it, redistribute it,
  commercialize it—anything. No strings attached.
* Celebrates gratitude: The only “condition” is not legal—it's social. If this
  code makes your day easier, you're invited to say thanks, perhaps over a
  drink, if life brings us together.

## Who Is It For?

Cheersware is for developers, artists, makers, and tinkerers who want to:

* Share their work without overthinking legal implications.
* Foster a culture of openness and gratitude.
* Avoid license fatigue from choosing between dozens of licenses that all say
  more or less the same thing.
* Contribute to a friendlier open-source ecosystem.

This license isn’t about control—it's about trust and community. You don’t need
a lawyer to understand it. You just need to believe that sharing knowledge
should be as effortless as clinking glasses.

So go ahead—fork it, build on it, remix it, sell it, teach with it. And if you
feel like it helped you, maybe say “cheers” someday.

That’s it.
