## About the Cheersware License

The Cheersware License is a simple, human-readable license that encourages sharing and gratitude. Instead of complex legal jargon, it suggests a simple "cheers" ‚Äì a coffee, tea, or beer ‚Äì if you find the licensed software useful and happen to meet the author.

## How to Use the Cheersware License in Your Project

1.  **Copy the license text:** Go to the [Cheersware License Website](https://your-github-username.github.io/your-repo-name/) (replace with the actual GitHub Pages URL once deployed) or grab the text from the `LICENSE` file in this repository.
